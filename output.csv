I grew fond of the community and began reflecting on Ethereum and the community’s ethos. At that point, I knew that I needed to find a place in the Ethereum ecosystem and since then I’ve found ways to become involved with a few DeFi teams by creating graphics/motion graphics for them. I started working in a DAO, and began full time in crypto.\\nAs an artist, it used to be a difficult challenge to find the market for selling the artwork and for that reason when I began learning about NFTs – It was a no-brainer for me and I immediately knew I was going to be in this space for the long run. At about this time, I acquired motiondesign.eth and set in motion my plans for entering the space. Since, I have been looking for a cc0 project that I could sink my teeth into. When I discovered Lil Nouns, I immediately fell in love! I love Nouns artwork, and Lil Nouns gave me a way to enter into the Noun community. Seeing the Noun community grow over the months has been amazing and I want nothing more than to be a part of it. \",\"tldr\":\"Create 1000 Lil Noun 1 of 1 artworks and modeled t-pose for each Lil Noun minted 1 through 1000 \",\"links\":\"\",\"parentAuctionId\":4}","signature":"0x144d7b13570cb98a15ade78d382bbb106fad2ee65c522dced8217bd2f5efe3784797053736723b25f4341d4ebc4976e44e94eb2443f3c9918cfdd26aea5d2a0e00"},"id":386,"visible":true,"isWinner":false,"title":"1000 Lil Nouns by Motiondesign.eth","who":"","what":"Project Details\nI would like to create 1000 Lil Noun 1 of 1 artworks for each Lil Noun minted 1 through 1000 and then airdrop the artwork to holders along with a modeled t-pose of their Lil Noun in likeness to the models made for Meebits.

I grew fond of the community and began reflecting on Ethereum and the community’s ethos. At that point, I knew that I needed to find a place in the Ethereum ecosystem and since then I’ve found ways to become involved with a few DeFi teams by creating graphics/motion graphics for them. I started working in a DAO, and began full time in crypto.\nAs an artist, it used to be a difficult challenge to find the market for selling the artwork and for that reason when I began learning about NFTs – It was a no-brainer for me and I immediately knew I was going to be in this space for the long run. At about this time, I acquired motiondesign.eth and set in motion my plans for entering the space. Since, I have been looking for a cc0 project that I could sink my teeth into. When I discovered Lil Nouns, I immediately fell in love! I love Nouns artwork, and Lil Nouns gave me a way to enter into the Noun community. Seeing the Noun community grow over the months has been amazing and I want nothing more than to be a part of it.

We already have examples of the Lil Noun art style (e.g. the classroom image on lilnouns.wtf and the traits themselves) to build upon, and Figma is extremely intuitive, anyone could easily learn to put an image together if the assets were ready to use.\n\n### What would this library include?\n1. Common visual elements such as furniture, animals, plants, etc.\n2. Illustrations of Web3 concepts Lil Noun style (for example the model of a blockchain as if it was created by actual kids, with cardboard boxes and paper cutouts).\n3. A basic design system inculding a color library, text styles, icons.\n+1. Developing the logo font, if it's not an already existing one.\n\nThese are my initial ideas, the final scope and details should be discussed with the community and the Lil Nounders.\n\n### Example use cases for the library\nAny digital or physical product we put out would benefit from a ready to use asset collection. The idea of lilnouns.blog has been floating around for a while, illustrating each post with an on-brand picture would be a breeze. Leaning into the Web3 onboarding direction and creating short videos? Here's a quickstart. I want to build a cute room for my Lil Nouns cause I love them so much? Why not?\n\n### Why me?\nI've 10+ years of experience with traditional and digital graphic design, and been working as a UI/UX designer since I graduated. I love Figma, I have experience in multiple styles of illustration and with building design systems. My portfolio hasn't been updated in over a year (yeah i know) but I'll gladly show some relevant works.\n\n### The budget\n2 ETH: Designer's fee for me, and if the final scope demands it another designer. This initial phase of building would be pretty labor intensive, that's why I ask for the grant, but I would happily keep on extending this library bit by bit to keep giving to the community.\n\nCheers!\nLilnoun1112","tldr":"Build a library of assets in Lil Noun style for community use, making meme proliferation and content creation easier.","links":"","auctionId":4,"score":"13","createdDate":"2022-06-07T10:38:33.986Z","lastUpdatedDate":"2022-06-15T11:40:06.841Z","timestamp_unix":1654598313,"url":"https://prop.house/lil-nouns"},{"address":"0x3F54fe126E7d4eCF4403eC5482281e610E684AEe","signedData":{"signer":"0x3F54fe126E7d4eCF4403eC5482281e610E684AEe","message":"{\"title\":\"Cloud Nine Kits ☁️ \",\"who\":\"\",\"what\":\"The term cloud nine is a metaphor for being on top of the world, going to heaven, and feeling happy.

My name is Ryan Willis. I am the founder of Art Is My Weapon.io and Neuroverse.dao\\nI am an Autistic artist and TBI survivor, creating a haven for Neurodiverse, Artists & Addicts. Before Art was my weapon, Food was my Weapon. When my traumatic brain injury occurred, I was a corporate R&D Chef but then after I was put on medical leave of absence, I began painting. In 2017 I created Art Is My Weapon and in 2018 I created the National Art Alliance for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, llc. but I was alone and this endeavor failed for the moment. Now, I am garnering a community filled with beautiful souls and brilliant minds seeking to offer their gifts, knowledge and love with the world as I do. In Neuroverse DAO(currently serving as a Discord at this point) there are 7 categories: Art Is My Weapon, Music Is My Weapon, Food Is My Weapon, Mental Health, NFTGaming, NFThinkTank and Live Sober/Cali Sober.

These experience can be On-Chain or Off-Chain.\nThere is support for in App payments via CC payments as well as Ethereum and a BSC bridge.\nYou are able to insert hyperlinks to objects and also display NFT's on Opensea directly in these experiences.\nThere is also Selfie-To-Avatar Creation so you are able to join others from across the world in the same Augmented Reality experience all while looking like yourself!\nThe potential and opportunitites are truly unlimited and we're just getting started.\n\"OVER divided the world into 300 m2 hexagonal Spatial Domains, mapped 1-to-1 to actual geographic locations.\nLike web domains, ownership of OVRLands (based on NFT standards) grants control of AR experiences in the defined geo-location.\nLand scanning allows for precise localization of AR assets to geographic locations, creating a bridge between the physical and virtual AR Metaverse.\"\n\n![Imaginoun One](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db8600f68eae7671fe48a4e/ce130085-93dc-4896-8d07-3daea09ae167/download+%281%29.png?format=500w)\n![Imaginoun Two](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db8600f68eae7671fe48a4e/eff0de91-6b9e-4091-b06d-2b19fffbe026/download+%2816%29.png?format=500w)\n![Imaginoun Three](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db8600f68eae7671fe48a4e/13fef9b9-9587-4ea3-a295-9ed0f8601455/Imaginouns1.jpg?format=1000w)\n![Imaginoun Four](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5db8600f68eae7671fe48a4e/9047b5a7-cbc7-4413-b94c-a2d2ae0abdea/download+%284%29.png?format=500w)\n![Imaginoun Five](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109_gxgZuvLDbtd6SIKk666CXRsAZV46b/view?usp=drivesdk)\n\n**Background:**\n\nHello Nouners! My name is Ryan Willis. I am the founder of Art Is My Weapon.io and Neuroverse.dao\nI am an Autistic artist and TBI survivor, creating a haven for Neurodiverse, Artists & Addicts. Before Art was my weapon, Food was my Weapon. When my traumatic brain injury occurred, I was a corporate R&D Chef but then after I was put on medical leave of absence, I began painting. In 2017 I created Art Is My Weapon and in 2018 I created the National Art Alliance for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, llc. but I was alone and this endeavor failed for the moment. Now, I am garnering a community filled with beautiful souls and brilliant minds seeking to offer their gifts, knowledge and love with the world as I do. In Neuroverse DAO(currently serving as a Discord at this point) there are 7 categories: Art Is My Weapon, Music Is My Weapon, Food Is My Weapon, Mental Health, NFTGaming, NFThinkTank and Live Sober/Cali Sober. Within these are subcategories such as art classes in all mediums, cooking classes, music production workshops, NFT collaboration, organized gaming, Sobriety meetings, as well as keynote presentations on Psychology, Neurodiversity and Mental Health to name a few. \nI am so excited at the idea of being able to collaborate with an organization like Nouns. Creative possibilities are only as limited as the imagination. In Imaginouns, if you can dream it you can do it.\nArt Is My Weapon is also the proud founder of https://Imaginouns.com and looking forward to these Nountastic Collaborations.\n\n**Cost:**\nWill vary dependent on location and price of Virtual Land.\n\n**References:**\n\n[YouTube](https://youtube.com/channel/UClL523TWq4w67ZZzmPvONzQ)\n\n[Opensea](https://opensea.io/ArtIsMyWeapon)\n\n[VR Gallery](https://www.cyber.xyz/artismyweapon)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArtIsMyWeapon_)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/artismyweapon)\n\n[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-willis-289325154)\n\n[AtomicHub](https://wax.atomichub.io/market?collection_name=paintedpixel)\n\n[TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTdHMbj7T/)\n\n[ArtIsMyWeapon](ArtIsMyWeapon.io)\n\n[Imaginouns](imaginouns.com)\n\n[Imaginouns Twitter](https://twitter.com/imaginouns)\n","tldr":"Imaginouns is buying Virtual Land plots to bring Nouns to life in Augmented Reality Scenes across the Globe.

Even if you’re giving away junk – it’s the thought that counts, right? In German schools, workplaces and social circles, people often organize a so-called Schrottwichteln. The word Schrott means “crap”, “garbage” or “junk”. Wichteln is the organized exchange of gifts during the holiday season. So people who participate in Schrottwichteln essentially give each other things they don’t want themselves – like that ugly Christmas sweater they received from their grandmother or an overly fancy candleholder for which they have no use.</p><p><br></p><p>When people organize a Schrottwichteln, they will often set a limit on the value of the item – perhaps 5, 10, 15 or 20 Euros. Participants usually have a few days to decide on a gift – and will often search for the ugliest, funniest or most useless possible item they can think of.

In Germany, however, we have what’s called Schrottwichteln, which basically means “the exchange of crap”.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>My proposal is to arrange a Schrottwichteln around the globe for the upcoming Christmas time for the community. Anyone from&nbsp;the community who would like to participate can register and be assigned another random lil noun. The best gift can be voted on and the winner can choose a charity organisation of his choice which will receive 2 ETH from the treasury for Christmas.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><u>What do I understand under Schrottwichteln?</u></p><p><br></p><p>The holiday season is all about gift exchanges. Even if you’re giving away junk – it’s the thought that counts, right? In German schools, workplaces and social circles, people often organize a so-called Schrottwichteln. The word Schrott means “crap”, “garbage” or “junk”. Wichteln is the organized exchange of gifts during the holiday season. So people who participate in Schrottwichteln essentially give each other things they don’t want themselves – like that ugly Christmas sweater they received from their grandmother or an overly fancy candleholder for which they have no use.</p><p><br></p><p>When people organize a Schrottwichteln, they will often set a limit on the value of the item – perhaps 5, 10, 15 or 20 Euros. Participants usually have a few days to decide on a gift – and will often search for the ugliest, funniest or most useless possible item they can think of. Sometimes Schrottwichteln organizers will choose a “winner” – a gift that is the most worthless of all. In my opinion we should change this into “the best new benefit”. The gifts should not represent junk, but things that are, for example, self-made or already in your ownership but without a use.</p><p><br></p><p>Here some inspiration for beautiful gift ideas:</p><p><br></p><p>- Bags made from recycled plastic from the ocean&nbsp;</p><p>- Clothes made from plastic bottles</p><p>- Upcycled furniture/lamps</p><p><br></p><p>There are so many ways to make the world a little better place....</p><p>&nbsp;</p>","tldr":"Gifting other random nouns around the globe things u don't use anymore for Christmas.

Our goal build out a story to lil nouns and make them relatable while staying true to the pixelated imagery created in the original artwork. Our primary aim to educate others about lilnounsdao and illustrate how to get involved in the dao.\n\nProject Goals:\n•\tTo provide an overview of lilnounsdao (auction, discourse, grants, prop-house, on chain proposals, noun ethos, Coordinape, while also highlighting and celebrating projects that are in the lilnouns ecosystem).\n•\tTo create an engaging experience.\n•\tImprove marketing outreach by providing high-value content that furthers lil nouns mission of educating people on lil nouns. \n•\tRemove confusion of selecting which funding method is best for someone to choose given their project goals.\n•\tMake audience smile.\n\nPast Discussion:\nhttps://discord.gg/xjARUcB3tJ  channel #lilnouns-video\nhttps://discourse.lilnouns.wtf/t/proposal-for-animated-lil-noun-introductory-video/190\n\nConclusion:\nLil nouns branding has been an ongoing discussion and this proposal is a step toward delivering a brand marketing strategy built collaboratively by nounish community members in a decentralized way. This project further hones in answering the question “what is lil nouns ethos?” \n\nMethodology\n\nFirst stage: pre-production\nScript and storyboard – initial stages of the production process. Provides a better visualization and helps team members understand flow of the video as well as to improve coordination between team members.\nThere are two scripts in this project. For example, atareh.eth has scripted his narration which he will record describing the educational points we want to convey to the audience. There is also scripting of the animation sequence which is later created into a storyboard sequence of shots to assist in visualizing the final results.\nModeling Scene and Characters – Modeling complex characters where the topology assists in creating good movements for the characters. This stage will also include creation of pixel art which is later converted into to a model and then topology optimized for animation. (2-4 weeks)\nTextures and materials – Creating 2D images that are baked into the material. The largest amount of time will be in regard to materials for visual effects. (3 days to 1 week maximum for all material creation)\nRigging and Pre-animation prep: Rigging characters to optimize for performance and designed for natural movements. This can take 2 months however, it will be significantly less because most will be completed prior to going on chain with the proposal (as pre-animation steps are completed at this point and general movements defined).\n\nSecond Stage: production\nAnimation: The model has gone through the pre-animation stages. Once we have staged the scene we will be able to animate out the scene. Once we reached this point, I estimate “staging the animation of the scene” should take 1-2 weeks.\nLighting: Each scene is slightly different in regard to lighting. The scene that will take the longest to light will be scene 5. (Estimating 3 days - 1 week)\nVisual Effects (VFX) and composite: Visual effects for this project include dematerialization of lil noun and getting sucked into the computer screen, (lava) volcano erupting and fireworks. I’ve already begun completing the more complex aspects of creating these visual effects so once we bring them into the scene, it shouldn’t take longer than 1-2 weeks.\n\nThird stage: post-production\nSound effects: 1 week (or longer if we are including the suggestion to include the dao on decision for which theme song we use. If there are revisions requested by the dao then the time will extend.\nRendering: The longest portion of this task is the rendering of the visual effects which include the lil noun being sucked into the computer, and fireworks. I estimate 1 week maximum for all rendering.\nPost- render edits: This is where we collect all of the rendered shots and compile them into scenes. From here, we will edit the shots within a scene, then we will edit the scenes together. (1-2 weeks).\nReview and final adjustments: At this point there will be very little left to do. Smaller changes to audio and editing can be made. 1 week\nWe also want to reserve some flexibility with the timeline to allow for interacting with the dao. We want to provide the dao with as much creative input/interaction with the builders as we can.\n\nWe’ve begun compiling a list of assets that lilnoun1112 will be pixelating:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SbS8O0oTyYaCdO2lG6ttCk3rD6_ROyRAehqDRKG8k0M/edit#gid=0\n\nOn screen recordings needed:\nprophouse>lilnounsdao>connect\nlilnouns(dot)wtf> DAO >Submit proposal\ndiscord>lil grants> one or two sentences typed in the field saying “we started working on…etc”\ndiscourse> we can use the discourse we made for this project and record that\nlilnouns(dot)wtf> Playground\n\nCurrent Progress:\nYou can follow progress on this live by looking in the #lilnouns-video channel under projects in the lilnouns discord. We’ve blocked out scene 1 in order to show a pre video video as requested once we brought this proposal to discourse. We are currently in the animating stages for scene 1.\n\nWe’ve also typed up a script that the lil nouns will perform:\n\nList of Scenes\n\nScene 1 [introduction/LoL delegates and illustrating auction process]\nThe video begins with a lilnoun car pulling up to a lilnoun house. The lilnoun car has a bunch of nouns in it and one lil noun (lil noun pencil). The nouns are dropping off lil pencil and we follow him into the nounisouri where we meet a bunch of lil nouns who are hanging out and doing things in the nounisouri. The pencil lil noun walks into the nounisouri and starts writing about what he’s been discussing with nouns on a chalkboard while other lil nouns watch… one lil noun raises his hand to ask a question.\nMeanwhile, a panda lil noun sits at a table where he sips a coffee, we follow the panda as he hops off his chair (which is oversized for him because he is lil) and he carries his coffee over to the computer where he works. He boots up the computer and opens the browser to [lilnouns(dot)wtf]. He checks the auction and see’s a lilnoun that he loves and reacts by throwing his hands up and then touching his lilnoun face/adjusting his glasses. Shots will flip between closeup of lil noun as he puts in a bid and the computer screen showing a new counter-bid[gradually speed up the shots as the time of the auction runs out]. As the auction nears it’s end the Panda is growing more excited and nervous hoping he will win the auction. At the end of the auction where he wins and a new lil noun appears in the room magically from a bunch of small particles. The lil noun quickly glances over to look at his new lilnoun and they hug.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tEvery 15 minutes, a new lil noun is born. The auction is open and anyone can bid. Submit your bid on-chain\n•\tIf someone bids more than you before the auction ends, your ETH is refunded back to your wallet. You have the option to bid higher.\n•\tIf someone bids in the last minute, 1 minute is added to the auction time to give everyone an opportunity to send new bids\n•\tAt the end of the auction, if you have the highest bid, the lil noun is yours! Settling the auction mints a lil noun to your wallet, and begins a new auction\n\nScene 1 Summary: This demonstrates the lilnoun auction process and briefly highlights the role of a delegate.\n\nScene 2 [finding the right sort of funding for the project]\nThe Panda then stretches his legs and walks around the room [while doing a subtle dance] as he makes his way over to his work area in the nounisouri where he has three projects. [these three projects are later used to highlight the most appropriate method for submitting each respective prop] Each project is slightly different, there is a small project [science fair volcano], a medium project [tbd] and a large project [robot arm]. Panda begins tinkering with the science fair volcano [small project]. It erupts and creates a giant mess! He works some more and fixes it. He pulls out a camera and takes some photos of the volcano and then loads the photos into his computer. He enters a chat window and begins typing. While he is typing he is de-materialized into a bunch of small particles which are then sucked into the computer screen. A fellow lil noun standing nearby reacts to him being sucked in the computer screen and looks over with a quick head jerk[setting changes]. The panda then appears in a gymnasium where we that the room is full of other lil nouns who have their projects on display and are talking with other lil nouns about them/getting feedback. He carries his project over to an open booth and sets it up while he is getting prepared lil nouns come and speak to him to ask him about his project and provide feedback. The scene ends with a shot of the panda shaking hands with another lilnoun. [everything in the scene de-materializes and the panda materializes back to his seat in the nounisouri.\n\nScene 2 summary: brings up the topic that there are many ways to be funded/the art of choosing the best funding method for your project is an art.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tProjects in lilnouns DAO are bucketed into three categories depending on how much funding is needed: small, medium and large\n•\tFor small projects, you have the option to apply for prophouse funding, which runs new auctions every 2 weeks. This is usually for projects under 1-2 ETH\n•\tFor medium-sized projects, applying for small grants is the best route. Small grants can get you up to 10 ETH in funding\n•\tFor large projects that require more than 10 ETH in funding, the best route is to go on-chain.\n\nScene 3 [illustrating prop house/submitting his project for funding using pro]\nNow that the Panda has gotten feedback from other lil nouns, he is ready to submit for funding. The lil noun paces back and forth for a moment and sips his coffee. Then walks over to the computer again. He pulls up the browser window and loads up prophouse. He again is de-materialized into the computer and reappears in a new location - a room full of doorways. Each door representing a different house (lil nouns, nouns, mfers, sharks, nounjapan, nounpunks, etc.) He walks into the lil nouns prop house and as he walks through the doorway he finds himself in a room that resembles a museum. He then finds a place after being guided there by another lil noun and sets his project up for display. [sets his project down and then presses a remote control that puts a HUD around his project highlighting different features of it. Once he sets up his project, he begins looking around the museum and voting on other projects he likes. Each time he votes, a green check mark appears over his shoulder and follows him around as he looks at each project. He finally comes to the end of the museum where he approaches a ballot box. Once he reaches it, he does a lil hop and grabs the check-marks that have been floating above him while he walked through the museum and then places the check-marks into the ballot box. [fade out/in] The scene is of a stage where the ones who have one the round of prop house are being celebrated for winning. But unfortunately Panda didn’t get selected. He walks toward the exit of the museum which is a revolving door and while he pushes himself through the exit, the scene de-materializes and the panda re-materializes back in the nounisouri.\nScene 3 Summary: Shows a small project getting funding using prophouse. discusses how small projects would be best directed toward this funding method.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tIf you have a small project that doesn’t need a lot of funding, or you’re running a short pilot, you can decide to apply for prophouse funding\n•\tIn prophouse, ideas are submitted and apply for a fixed amount of ETH. Community members can vote for their favourite ideas. The number of projects that gets funded depends on the amount of ETH available for that round\n•\tFor example, if there is 10 eth total, and each successful project gets funded with 2 eth, then the top 5 vote getting proposals will automatically be funded.\nScene 4 [illustrating discourse and prepares audience for scene 5]\nThe lil noun materializes back into the nounisouri from the browser. At this point, a bunch of lil noun friends come to visit him and encourage him to keep trying after not receiving funding from the prop house round. He is relieved that they’ve been so helpful and nice and feels welcome amongst friends. They all do fancy handshakes as they huddle around. Then Island lil noun notices from the corner of his ⌐◨-◨ and see’s the medium sized project that Panda was working on. He gestures to everyone “we can try and help to fix it!” [text box pops up over his head then disappears again]. They decide they want to try and fix it but they don’t know how! “where do we start?” they ask one another [textbox over the head of one of lil nouns]. They begin to try a few ideas but no luck. Wondering what to do next, they walk over to another lil noun who is sitting reading a book {void lilnoun} and ask him to look at the project. He joins the group in collaborating on the project and after a few questions and suggestions [lil nouns interacting using body language to describe things about the project]. Then all of a sudden a light bulb appears over Panda and he knows how to fix it. He shares his idea with his lil noun friends and they all begin collaborating together to make it work. Once they’ve fixed it, they take a bunch of photos of the project and head over to the computer again where they open discourse in hope to discuss their project and get feedback once again. [Panda gets de-materialized again] and he finds himself at a round table full of other lil nouns. He explains his project to everyone who then begin clapping and standing up from the round table. [Panda de-materializes again and reappears back in the nounisouri where he excitedly shares the positive feedback with his friends].\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tIf you don’t get funding, it’s okay! take feedback and incorporate it and continue forward\n•\tOften, other lilnouners are a great resource and can be very helpful to get you over hurdles.\n•\tDon’t be shy to seek feedback and assistance from other lilnoun members. They might give you feedback, could help unblock you on a specific task, or join your team! Team work is dreamwork\n•\tA great place to get feedback is discourse - post your idea there.\n\nScene 4 Summary: distinguishes between two options that lil nouns have to engage in discussion the dao (discord and discourse). Highlights inclusivity when working and seeking out feedback from others.\n\nScene 5 [grant scene]\nHe runs over to the table where he has paper and a pencil. He starts writing and in big letters writes proposal. He begins writing, and out the window you can see the sun starting to go down. [fadein/out with moving lil nouns all around the table where he works indicating time is moving]. Aerial shot of all lil nouns huddled over a table with blueprints and plans sprawled out on a centrally lit table/in a dimly lit room indicating they are working in the late hours of the night [fade in/out of shots with lil nouns moving in the shot between each fade and the blueprints being added to more and more over time [the scene gradually lights up brighter as the sun rises again]. They finish, and set the blueprint on an easel and all the lil nouns take a group photo next to it. They then head over to the computer where they review the checklist for a grant request and clicks request grant. Some time goes by again using fadein/out effect we’ve used throughout this scene and a popup window showing they were not approved appears on the computer screen. They were unsuccessful and have to try again.\n\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tFor lil noun grants, you can submit a proposal in discord + discourse.\n•\tWhile prophouse is great for small projects and pilots and for individuals, small grants can help fund a pilot or small project with a team\n•\tThe small grants committee decides whether your grant will either be approved or needs a bit of restructuring to get feedback\n•\tIf you don’t get grant funding, that’s alright. Get some feedback and try again!\nScene 5 Summary: Provides an introduction into a funding option where you might apply for a grant. Highlights the grant proposal process as well as collaboration. Distinguishes between how prop house may better fund an individual working on a proposal and how grants is better equipped to fund a small team. Also will touches on the point that lil nouns can be funded in the request for a grant[the grant in the scene will have a request including lil noun].\n\nScene 6 [Transition scene: introduction into Large project]\nAt this point all the lil nouns in the nounisouri are exhausted and lying around on the couch. The lil nouns pause from the work and go outside to play on the playground. On the playground, there are lil nouns building new lil nouns to be included in auctions in the future.\nAfter the lil nouns come back into the nounisouri, the scene shows a lil noun who is sitting on the couch throws a paper airplane, another is playing paper football with another lil noun. The paper airplane flys through the air and hits panda in the head and all of a sudden, panda has an idea! He begins digging through spare parts lying around the nounisouri. He plugs the parts into the large project and it works [ the project begins lighting up ] [Over the shoulder shot of the project looking down at the lil nouns and the reflection from the lights illuminating the faces of lil nouns as they stare up at the project]. [fade out]\nTalking points (Narration):\n________________________________________\nScene 6 Summary: Demonstrates lil nouns trying again after narration just hinted at the topic. Discusses creating new lil nouns.\n•\tOn the lilnouns website, try playing around and generating new lilnouns.\n•\tThe playground gives you a chance to generate your own lilnoun (for fun) - see which traits are available, and find your favourite lilnoun head\n•\tYou can also upload your own art as a trait to see what it would look like as a lilnoun. Some time in the future, the lilnounsdao will be accepting new traits for lilnouns (just like nounsdao just did). Your art could be featured in lilnouns!\n\nScene 7 [illustrating DAO on chain]\nAll the lilnouns are huddled around the computer screen, each squishing themselves closer to the computer so that they can see. The lil noun moves his mouse to click on the DAO link in [lilnouns(dot)wtf] while his lil noun friend has hands pushing up and down on his shoulders [excitedly/gently pushing]. He clicks the link and this time all the lil nouns de-materialize into the computer and appear in a courtroom setting where a gavel lil noun is leading a discussion with a ton of lil nouns in a stadium like seating (looks maybe like a Colosseum) around a center stage. The lil nouns walk out onto the stage pulling their large project out on a wagon and wheeling it over to the gavel lil noun. They reach gavel lil noun and each shakes his hand gracefully. [A shot of the audience cheering]. The gavel lil noun raises his hands [ and the jumbo-tron behind him has the word VOTE! pop up] indicating to all the lil nouns in the stadium that it is time to vote. We start to see lil red and green signs with an X or a check mark indicating their vote appear throughout the audience. More green than red lights appear and the vote is passed and fireworks go off. The gavel smacks the podium and the vote is over. They won and they all de-materialize again into the nounisouri. One lil noun walks up to the chalkboard and writes Day 1 and underlines it. The end.\nTalking points (Narration):\n•\tFor large projects, you get to submit a prop onchain.\n•\tCurrently, you need 3 lilnouns to submit a prop onchain. This limit increases with each 1000 new lilnouns minted (i.e. when lilnouns # reaches #3000, 4 lil nouns will be required to submit a prop on chain).\n•\tThe proposal should have sufficient detail on what it is you’re trying to do, how this benefits the lilnouns DAO, how much funding you’re requesting, and the wallet address where the requested ETH should be transferred\n•\tIf this is your first time creating transactions and you need help with creating transactions for the proposal, feel free to ask someone more experienced in the DAO for help. There are many willing hands available.\n•\tWhen you’re ready to put your proposal on chain, head over to lilnouns(dot)wtf/dao and submit it\n•\t(can show the full process of going on chain)\nScene 7 Summary: Highlights how to submit proposals on chain","status":"ACTIVE","createdTimestamp":"1658503070","title":"# Animated Lil Nouns Introduct...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/31","timestamp_unix":"1658503070"},{"id":"30","description":"# Lil Sisters Fund\n\n## tl;dr\n\nThis is a proposal to create a Lil Sisters Fund (just like Lil Grants) to allocate fast capital to women and non-binary builders.\n\n## Lil Sisters Fund\n\nAs part of our mission of creating an accessible on-ramp to Nouns, we propose establishing a pool of funds to encourage women and non-binary creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns.

Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors.\n\n### **Lil Grants Pool**\n\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO.\n\nProposed budget: 50 ETH and 14 Lil Nouns NFTs*\n\nThe aim of the pool will be to:\n\n1. Acknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\n2. Grant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n3. Reward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\n4. Signal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n5. Return Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community.\n- As part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. At the time of the proposal, this amounts to 28 Lil Nouns. Since we sent 14 Lil Nouns in season 1, this round will add an additional 14 Lil Nounders to the Lil Grants safe.\n\n### **Funding Committee**\n\nThe Lil Grants Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `2 of 5` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool.\n\nThe initial signers on the Safe will be:\n\n- Lil Noun 482 (lil world)\n- Lil Noun 129 (lil john)\n- Lil Noun 317 (bflynn)\n- Lil Nounder Dot\n- Lil Nouns DAO\n- Lil Noun 449 (lil al409)\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.","status":"EXECUTED","createdTimestamp":"1656388232","title":"# Lil Grants Season 2TLDR: R...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/22","timestamp_unix":"1656388232"},{"id":"21","description":"# Buy Noun 235\n\n## **Buy Noun 235**\n\n\nNoun 235 has been listed for sale onchain to Lil Nouns DAO.

I’m a partially doxxed (face only) content creator and writer in web3. Through this proposal, my goal is lead content efforts at lilnouns as the chief content creator. This role combines content creation, strategy, planning, and execution; combining my background as a former aspiring professor, web2 technical product manager and my current role as a writer/content creator in web3.\n\nI am focusing on a 3-month chief content creator role, with the possibility to extend should the DAO find my contributions and execution worthwhile afterwards. So, who am I, what is my experience, and why is content valuable for lilnouns? \n\nLet me explain 🧵👇🏽\n\n\n## **Why does lilnouns need a chief content creator?**\n\nAt its core, any successful movement, (be it cryptocurrency, NFT project, or DAO) has a content strategy in place. Sometimes this strategy is created organically in the community (BAYC as pfps or .eth names on Twitter, both help with marketing), other times an organization has a hand in creating it. But without content, your message can’t spread and get out there. If your message can’t get out there, then people won’t hear about you, and if people don’t hear about you, you won’t grow. \n\nTo drive home my point, here’s an example: I’ve created a “cc0 Sunday” series, which goes over the news in the cc0 universe from the previous week - funded with the NounsDAO [prop.house](https://prop.house/proposal/140).\n\nIn just the second week, I had people reach out after winning a lilnouns auction, telling me they learned about the DAO through my cc0 Sunday series on YT. Content works. It’s one of the best ways to attract creatives, builders, and founders to the DAO. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-13 at 12.11.58 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsPk86Sw/Screen-Shot-2022-06-13-at-12-11-58-PM.png)\n\nSo, lilnouns needs someone thinking about content full-time. Right now, there is no content strategy, or one person thinking about media for the DAO. While there are small experiments being talked about, without someone thinking about the lilnouns narrative at large, the energy in the DAO might wane and slowly trickle away (especially in a bear market). In this time, we need to go on the offensive and define what lilnouns are and push a message and be a reminder that we are still here, we are still building. Having someone lead the content strategy, planning and execution for lilnouns is a great way to do it - and I think I’m your guy, here’s why. \n\n## **Proof of work: who I am + what is my experience**\n\nIn my past life, I was a molecular scientist, publishing 3 papers. Since then, I’ve founded an ed-tech startup that was used by thousands of university students, transitioned to web2 as a PM and Head of product, and after 6 years made the switch full-time to web3. I have 7+ years working in tech, mostly thinking about product. In web3, I focus on writing on [twitter](http://twitter.com/atareh), [substack](http://degenuniversity.substack.com) and content creation on [YT](https://www.youtube.com/c/DegenUniversity/videos) and podcasts.\n\nIn a content creator role, leaning on product management principles to understand what content is necessary, how to manage and delegate the execution of this across teams, and maintaining a backlog is absolutely crucial. This is where my PM background will drive value for the DAO.\n\n## **Examples of my work**\n\n- Written multiple longform threads on Twitter, like ([ex 1](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1528126971846066176), [ex 2](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1458858405146284033), [ex 3](https://twitter.com/atareh/status/1526636736759181313)).\n- Created [educational guides](https://degenuniversity.co/collections/frontpage) on Degen university\n- Create educational [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/DegenUniversity/videos) + podcast called “Daily Degen”\n- Create weekly videos on the happenings in the cc0 universe called “ [cc0 Sundays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZtdVCPVJq0)”\n- Write a newsletter for [Degen University](http://degenuniversity.substack.com)\n- Interviewed prominent builders like [lilnouner Bflynn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSDjk6M-RK8) (Rabbithole), and [Zeneca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMxQpMcL7cw) for the podcast\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-16 at 7.04.19 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MZCXWDxy/21.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-16 at 7.02.39 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/P5hxD5CJ/22.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/PqXjXLPb/Screen-Shot-2022-06-16-at-7-31-16-PM.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/7LtYj1mJ/24.png)\n\n## **Proof of stake: why you should trust me to run content at lilnouns**\n\nI’m a full-time degen, bull or bear market, I’m here to build learn and grow. Second, I’ve been focused on education in web3 (and more broadly, in my career. Originally, I wanted to be a university professor). Right now,  I’m building my name, career and reputation in web3. So, I have a lot at stake, I want to execute well and I think my skill set and focus are right for this role in lilnouns.\n\n## **What I will do during my tenure as Chief content creator**\n\nThere are two types of initiatives I want to tackle over the first 3 months in this role. The first are 1/1’s the other are ongoing content. My priorities will be to execute and deliver the 1/1 content based on the timeline proposed. Beyond that, I will start to tackle the content requests backlog.\n\n### **1/1 content**\n\n1/1 content is meant to be evergreen content. Once these are made (and made well), they will serve thousands of people for weeks, months and years going forward. The goal for this content is to front-load the effort and cost so that there is a long-term return. Think of it the same as you would a website update: invest in design, content, and web development and the website will serve you for years to come.\n\n1. **Educational onboarding series -** To help grow lilnouns and attract more people to the DAO and the movement, I will create a series of educational videos that gets people onboarded onto DAOs. This series will be for people that understand web3 and crypto at a beginner level but haven’t gone down the rabbithole. We’ll explain the absolute basics to be thorough (metamask, safety, interacting with web3 websites), to interacting with lilnouns, placing bids, and understanding to read proposals, and submitting their own proposals). These videos will be the first entry point to the lilnouns universe, so it’s important to leave a great impression.\n    \n    #### **Chapter breakdown**\n    \n    1. Chapter 1 - What is web3 and where do DAOs fit into it\n    2. Chapter 2 - The different kinds of DAO structures\n    3. Chapter 3 - The nouns/lilnouns DAO structure and the benefits\n    4. Chapter 4 - Getting started with web3 101: an overview of metamask, crypto exchanges, uniswap, NFTs)\n    5. Chapter 5 - Getting started with web3 102: web3 security best practices, avoiding scams\n    6. Chapter 6 - Getting started with lilnouns: how to bid (and win) an auction, how to read proposals, how to submit your own proposal\n    7. Chapter 7 - Getting involved with the DAO - how to understand and navigate lilnouns discord channels \n\n1. **cc0 culture onboarding Series -** There are two parts to being onboarded to a DAO (and broadly, web3) properly. The first is education in the technicals, which is what the first series will cover. The second (and arguably just as important) is explaining the culture and ethos of web3, DAOs, cc0, and nouns. cc0 can be unintuitive to understand and the thesis of lilnouns rests on this concept. This and other concepts, as well as historical examples of what DAOs can achieve, will be part of a second series I will produce, focused on educating everyone on the culture of the nouns ecosystem.\n    \n    #### **Chapter breakdown**\n    \n    1. Chapter 1 - The history of cc0 and why this matters\n    2. Chapter 2 - Seizing the memes of production with cc0\n    3. Chapter 3 - The power of memes + how they impact markets\n    4. Chapter 4 - The singular goal of nouns ecosystem: proliferating the meme\n    5. Chapter 5 - Who can get involved in the mission and how to do so\n    6. Chapter 6 - Nouns + DAOs: the vehicle to full-time work in web3\n\n1. **Lil Nouners initiation package -** A short one-pager notion page of everything someone new needs to know when they first win a lilnoun. From where to go to find certain information, how to get involved in proposals, and how to submit your own. This will be linked to when lilnouners win an auction and join.\n\n### **Ongoing engagements**\n\n1. Lilnouns **cc0 hour season 1 -** a weekly 1 hour podcast / video series with cc0 builders, thinkers, leaders in the space. The focus for season 1 will be to highlight builders and creatives in the lilnouns DAO. People with interesting backgrounds, rich history of creative work, and a good story to tell will have their chance to be highlighted to the lilnouns and cc0 community at large. The expected timeline to start this initiative is end of July, and so the scope includes 10 episodes total (with the possibility for follow on funding to continue the series into season 2).\n\n1. **Maintain and prioritize a content backlog -** In product management, you keep a pulse on what your customer's needs are and father feature requests in a backlog. In the same way, if the content is a product, then there will be a backlog of ideas based on the community’s needs. I will actively gather this, and prioritize this for execution. This will also serve as a database for currency content needs by the community, should anyone want to submit a proposal on-chain for content. \n\n## **Proposed compensation**\n\nI’m proposing that I am compensated $50K* paid over 3 months in USDC (via stream). This covers the work period between end of June to end of September. The first payment of the stream starts if the proposal is passed, and subsequent payments are issued 30 days after. \n\n- The equivalent of $60k `(to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution)` will be sent to the lilgrants multisig wallet (operated by lilal409 and lil world), convert $50k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream on sablier and the remaining ETH will be sent back to the DAO.\n\n## **Contributor compensation**\n\nWith the vast talent available in lilnounsDAO (graphic, video, motion graphics, editing), efforts on helping with content should be rewarded. To encourage and compensate lilnouns that contribute towards content created in this proposal, the lil nouns small grants will be able to cover the compensation the same day the pieces are delivered. \n\nI think this is a fair rate for the following:\n\n- I have an established immediate history of executing well-made content (twitter, writing, YT videos)\n- This rate is in line (a bit lower) on an annualized basis with what I was offered for content leadership role which I turned down in February - valuation was based on my experience in PM and success with content thus far\n- I am bringing 7+ years of product management experience, part of which includes running a content-focused ed-tech startup\n- This is a full-time 3-month effort.\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe main outcomes can be seen per month. What’s not explicit in this calendar view is the time spent booking guests + editing the podcast in months 2 and 3. What’s shown is the release schedule. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.00 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rpwwhZCL/t1.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.41 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rmdFTdPn/t2.png)\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-06-14 at 1.20.27 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/L8Ts3FPT/t3.png)\n\nThank you for reading and your consideration.

MakeWater.org. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with a mission “to empower students who want to make a difference in the world by giving them the tools and education to tackle real-world water issues collaboratively.” Using a unique blend of STEM education principles, experiential learning modules, and teamwork, Make Water prepares K-12 students to contribute knowledge and solutions that make real-world differences, and enter STEM fields as citizen scientists, innovative thinkers, and inspired change agents. \n\nLil Nouns and MakeWater.org both have an ethos for open source and innovating. A new learning module will be added to the program covering the basics of web3 and blockchain. Individual students will receive a unique MakeWater / LilNouns Collaborative POAP for participation in the Make Water program. Make Water will seek to include Nouns to the marketing materials, instructions, and packaging of its kits for Program participants.

I've been tasked with traveling to our client’s office and conducting meetings where I learned how their legacy systems operated, I demo’d the guidewire suites' out of the box functionality, and then held a variety of requirement gathering sessions for us to come up with a custom solution to tailor their business needs and build out OOTB Guidewire. I have worked on each aspect of this role from requirement gathering, translating requirements to our offshore development team, and demoing newly built functionality to the client and end users of the software, and lastly was responsible for QA testing and bug triage. \n\n- Started working as a content creator/contributor to the NounPunks community. \n- Requested to become a mod for lilnouns and have been getting involved since inception to help build value and structure for the community.\n\n# What I will do going forward:\n\n1. Discord revamp and scope redefining. - I believe we have some overlap in scope between channels and there can be confusion as to where folks should be communicating where. I’d like to help overhaul the process and build out onboarding documentation for newcomers assuming they are new to the space and new to being involved in a DAO. My goals when this is complete are to have a clearly defined scope of each channel and clearly defined processes for all aspects of communicating/collaborating/and building within the DAO. I will also continue moderating the discord on a daily basis and being available in the #ask-a-mod channel to help new users. \n\n2. Contributing to any proposals that will build value for the community. - I would like to contribute to organizing and facilitating our lilnouns townhalls alongside my fellow mods. I’d like to help enable and build our community alongside contributors who have ideas to better the DAO as a whole. The first contribution I was involved in was the creation of the first 1000 lilnouns POAP and I am continuing to work along side @souravinsights.eth @mfrs @fabioseva and any other contributors on the next phase of our lilnounspoap.com website. I would like to be involved in the Educational Video Series proposal by helping write scripts for content to help onboard new users and give them a one stop shop for everything they need to know about the DAO and how we operate/how they can get involved.\n\n3. Prop House - I would like to volunteer to lead our prophouse committee and help answer questions/guide people/teams who are looking to get their ideas up for prophouse rounds. I have been involved in prophouse since inception as NounPunks were the first nounish community that had governance abilities in the prophouse rounds. I really enjoy working with people and helping guide them to build their ideas and bring them to life.\n\n4. General QA/Requirement gathering to build/test/bug triage future functionality. This experience directly relates to my current job and it’s something I’ve always enjoyed. As we conceptualize new ideas to create value adding functionality on our website, I’d like to help in any way I can. \n\n# Funds requested:\n\n- 8 eth paid for the month of June 2022\n- 42 eth paid over ~5.7 months (July 1, 2022 through December 22, 2022) which equates to 7.36E/month\n\nRecipient:\nal409.eth address: 0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3\n","status":"EXECUTED","createdTimestamp":"1654484623","title":"# Residency for lilal409Hey ...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/15","timestamp_unix":"1654484623"},{"id":"14","description":"# Lil Dot for Nouns DAO representative\n\nWith the acquisition of Noun `#287` and soon `#253`, Lil Nouns need to choose a representative for Nouns DAO.\n\nThis prop seeks to delegate **`@lil dot`** as the first Nouns DAO representative for Lil Nouns.\n\n**Prop #12 vs #14?**\nProp #14 aligns with the [conversation](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/954146487779078254/982005880486785074) and [temperature check](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/975580862286553129/981663867379806348) happening in Discord.\n\n**Why Dot?**\nDot is someone who has gone out of their  way to add value to Nouns, including:\n- Founder of Lil Nouns\n- Created nounish OS tools\n- Contributing to Nouns as a **founding Nouncil member**","status":"ACTIVE","createdTimestamp":"1654440835","title":"# Lil Dot for Nouns DAO repres...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/14","timestamp_unix":"1654440835"},{"id":"13","description":"# Retroactive Funding and Lil Grants Pool\n\nTLDR: Replicate Nouns DAOs process in allocating fast capital to DAO contributors via small/retroactive grants. \n\n### **Intro**\n\nThe on-chain proposal process is not ideal for encouraging small, one-off, or alpha versions of projects/tooling. Eager creators shouldn’t have to wait days for an on-chain proposal to be passed to receive a small amount of ETH. The DAO should not have to submit a formal proposal each time it wants to quickly reward valuable contributors. \n\n### **Lil Grants Pool**\n\nWe propose establishing a pool of funds and Lil Nouns NFTs to encourage creators, devs, and artists to build with Lil Nouns. This pool of capital and NFTs, will be sent to a Gnosis Safe controlled by a small group of Lil Nouners and Lil Nouns DAO. \n\nProposed budget: 20 ETH and 14 Lil Nouns NFTs*\n\nThe aim of the pool will be to:\n\n1. Acknowledge past contributions to Lil Nouns through retroactive funding\n2. Grant funds for the development of small, one-off, or alpha version projects\n3. Reward ongoing contributors to Lil Nouns\n4. Signal that retroactive funding is a viable path to build on Lil Nouns\n5. Return Lil Nounder ownership back to to the community. \n\n*As part of this proposal design, the Lil Nounders expressed a desire to return a substantive portion of their ownership back to the community. To action this desire, they’ve recommended that every 90th Lil Noun will be sent to the Lil Grants safe to be given to community members. At the time of the proposal, this amounts to 14 Lil Nouns. Lill Nounders will manually send to the Lil Grants to the safe.\n\n### **Funding Committee**\n\nThe Lil Grants Committee will monitor the builder community, retroactively fund previous work as it comes up, and receive informal requests/applications for small project grants. The projects and amounts will be at the committee's discretion.\n\nThe committee’s gnosis safe will require `2 of 5` Lil Nouners to sign, with Lil Nouns DAO acting as a largely symbolic owner and backup. We recommend keeping the signer group small with a team of experienced signers and then add more as we scale up operations and size of the pool. \n\nThe initial signers on the Safe will be:\n\n- Lil Noun 482 (lil world)\n- Lil Noun 129 (lil john)\n- Lil Noun 317 (bflynn)\n- Lil Nounder Dot\n- Lil Nouns DAO\n\nThe committee is open for any Lil Nouners to submit suggestions for grants and contributors that they see as deserving of a reward.\n\n### **Who to Retro Fund Right Now**\n\nIn addition to the 20 ETH Safe, we propose the immediate funding of these contributors:\n\n- `2 ETH`  to [@SeaLaunch](https://twitter.com/SeaLaunch_) and [@andrewhong5297](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297?lang=en) each for setting up Dune Analytics Dashboards [One](https://dune.com/sealaunch/Lil-Nouns-DAO) and [Two](https://dune.com/ilemi) respectfully.\n- `0.5 ETH` to [@biologistbrian](https://twitter.com/biologistbrian) for their work on [Lil Nouns Tracker](https://twitter.com/LilNounsTracker)\n- `0.5 ETH` to [@7x7x7eth](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth?s=21&t=KxMqbRudizFpnDKEiYGGJA), [@subversieve](https://www.twitter.com/subversieve) and [@msg](https://twitter.com/msg) each for their work as moderators\n\nEach above contributor will also receive a Lil Noun.\n\n### **Transaction Details**\n\nThis proposal will execute the following transactions:\n\n- `20 ETH` sent to the `Retro Funding/Lil Grants Gnosis Safe` (0x9B1d89015F353707241a0f375770ecBdC05c2Ca9)\n- `2.00 ETH` sent to `sealaunch` (0x635Bed3F8b7d8C25305CEa707FF7149D6f2A61f9)\n- `2.00 ETH` sent to `andrewhong5297` (0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `biologistbrian` (0xcB1048aE44Bcd8533BdE98CC81187c332c737D4e)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `7x7x7xeth` (0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `subversieve` (0x8143AaD694567424162A949c1580c91D03437858)\n- `0.5 ETH` sent to `msg` (0x174d123cE1EF00EEBF1026fbF061a7a58A928Def)\n\n### **Further Info**\n* [Discord Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/977907501087469668)\n* [Temp Check](https://discord.com/channels/954142017556979752/975580862286553129/977923033660538880)","status":"EXECUTED","createdTimestamp":"1654382500","title":"# Retroactive Funding and Lil ...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/13","timestamp_unix":"1654382500"},{"id":"12","description":"# delegate Nouns voting power to nouncil.eth\n\nDelegate to Nouncil (a group within NounsDAO that represents the interests of builders) temporarily until we determine the best way to use our voting power.","status":"CANCELLED","createdTimestamp":"1654271664","title":"# delegate Nouns voting power ...","url":"https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/12","timestamp_unix":"1654271664"},{"id":"11","description":"# Change Quorum requirement from 10% to 5%\n\nThis proposal will reduce the number of YES votes required to pass a proposal from 10% of little noun supply (150 lil nouns at time of proposal creation) to 5% of lil noun supply (75 lil nouns at time of proposal creation).

This group is being coined “League of Lil’s” and we are asking you to select your top 4 favorite candidates to be selected.\n- Keep in mind, these folks are going to be engaging with our community heavily and the delegate that is selected within this group is going to represent us in token gated NounsDAO channel discussions. We need a strong candidate who is confident and engaged to best represent us in.\n- League of Lil’s are essentially a steering committee that will collect feedback from our community. Their job is to spark discussion and communicate about important topics/issues within Lil Nouns community and be the liaison between us and NounsDAO.\n- The will be sending out snapshot votes reflecting active NounsDAO proposals. They are responsible for making announcements to the community to participate in snapshot votes, and then casting the winning vote on the actual NounsDAO proposal on our behalf.\n- Once this group has been decided, the 5 of them will select the first official Nouns delegate. This delegate is going to be responsible for speaking on our behalf in the NounsDAO discord in their token gated channels.\n- Disclaimer: The elected representatives are subject to term limits, periodic check in’s on quality of work with the community to retain their role, and will receive a stipend for their efforts which will be decided by the community.\n\nHow am I supposed to vote?\n\n- This is a multi select poll in which we are requesting you select your top 4 favorite candidates. Please head over to #election-bios to read everyone’s submissions!\n- To properly vote, please click your top 4 favorite candidates and no additional candidates. Each candidate you select will get the quantity of votes that is equal to the number of Lil Noun tokens in your wallet.\n    - Example: Al holds 5 lilnouns. Each candidate he selects will get 5 votes each.\n    \n\nGood luck candidates!\n\n","choices":["Don Tildare","sthumph","Brook","Lil 1762","garnierfructis.eth","lil trav ⌐◨-◨","BitcoinBob ⌐◨-◨","vsvsvs","bkraaus","Psychdre","necfas","lil Hab"],"start":1656468984,"end":1656745200,"snapshot":"15042749","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1656468984,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0xf34a52280537fc1d8379a8feade36273e347971310742c4e733b659e06e75690"},{"id":"0x6dc4b7031fae5f578a25a53a6952361b591bd7b47a324632c1b0778d6d969c52","title":"test 4","body":"test 4","choices":["brook","al","dot","trav","this is a test"],"start":1656125254,"end":1656384454,"snapshot":"15021521","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1656125254,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0x6dc4b7031fae5f578a25a53a6952361b591bd7b47a324632c1b0778d6d969c52"},{"id":"0xec62818eec79372cefad58677d85aa5e32acc35b33c635d4e9005b2ca1ded597","title":"delegate election test part 2","body":"testing","choices":["Brook","Don Tildare","Slug","sthumph","Lil 1762","garnierfructis.eth","Lil Package","lil trav"],"start":1656124823,"end":1656384023,"snapshot":"15021492","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1656124823,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0xec62818eec79372cefad58677d85aa5e32acc35b33c635d4e9005b2ca1ded597"},{"id":"0x8433c952526630c5129706b97d26174174de81b963844a2fa630feb9255538b1","title":"Nouns Delegate Term 1 Test","body":"vote on our first rep test","choices":["signer 1","singer 2","singer 3","signer 4"],"start":1656124617,"end":1656383817,"snapshot":"15021477","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1656124617,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0x8433c952526630c5129706b97d26174174de81b963844a2fa630feb9255538b1"},{"id":"0x63468db9aca8e076ae8b770758360b57d9694601aec8cd83d25d87fb54bfeda2","title":"test","body":"testing weighted voting for lilnoun holders","choices":["nice","very nice"],"start":1655779093,"end":1656038293,"snapshot":"15000043","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1655779093,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0x63468db9aca8e076ae8b770758360b57d9694601aec8cd83d25d87fb54bfeda2"},{"id":"0xd5812c46feec8dfa2ebc910b71e8e68af6b8e68f1e112eebd18e38d51e0bf55f","title":"nounsdao proposal #test","body":"test","choices":["Yes","No","Abstain"],"start":1655443173,"end":1655702373,"snapshot":"14977434","state":"closed","author":"0x8BecD7EbF3F910090f9264DFD0Bb221Ea04af8c3","space":{"id":"al409.eth","name":"Lil Nouns DAO"},"timestamp_unix":1655443173,"url":"https://snapshot.org/#/al409.eth/proposal/0xd5812c46feec8dfa2ebc910b71e8e68af6b8e68f1e112eebd18e38d51e0bf55f"},{"id":7,"title":"Welcome to Lil Nouns Discourse","fancy_title":"Welcome to Lil Nouns Discourse","slug":"welcome-to-lil-nouns-discourse","posts_count":1,"reply_count":0,"highest_post_number":1,"image_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-24T06:42:52.260Z","last_posted_at":"2022-05-24T06:42:52.323Z","bumped":true,"bumped_at":"2022-05-25T17:41:43.686Z","archetype":"regular","unseen":false,"pinned":true,"unpinned":null,"excerpt":"Thanks for visiting the Lil Nouns Discourse; we are glad you’re here! \nThis project is better when everyone is thinking about how to make things a lil better.
